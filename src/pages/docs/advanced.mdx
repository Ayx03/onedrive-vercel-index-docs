Some of the more advanced configurations here. You may or may not be looking for them.

## Using your own `clientId` and `clientSecret`

If you are not the admin of your OneDrive account, you may not be able to use the project's `clientId` and `clientSecret` provided by me. In this case, you would need to generate your own client id and secret for authentication.

### Create your own pair of `clientId` and `clientSecret`

Use [beetcb/ms-graph-cli](https://github.com/beetcb/ms-graph-cli) to create your own pair of `clientId` and `clientSecret`.

### Modify configs in `api.config.js`

You can directly replace `clientId` with your generated `clientId`.

However, client secret is more involved. You need to obfuscate it with AES encryption, which can be done online with [https://www.dute.org/aes](https://www.dute.org/aes).

- Original text is your client secret.
- Encryption key is `onedrive-vercel-index`.
- Encryption/Decryption method is CBC (Cipher Block Chaining, Default).
- Finally press AES encryption to encrypt your client secret.

You should get an obfuscated client secret which looks like:

```
U2FsdGVkX1830zo3/pFDqaBCVBb37iLw3WnBDWGF9GIB2f4apzv0roemp8Y+iIxI3Ih5ecyukqELQEGzZlYiWg==
```

Replace the `obfuscatedClientSecret` with this value.

If you changed `redirectUri` to something other than `http://localhost`, you need to change that in `api.config.js` as well.
